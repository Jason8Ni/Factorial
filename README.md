1\. What does the program do?

The program is very simple, it calculates the factorial for an integer that the user inputs.

2\. Directory structure:

There is only one branch and every file is in that branch. Due to its simplicity, there is no need to have a whole architecture for the directory structure.

3\. Running the build pipeline:

Just run the bash file

4\. Why is DevOps important for WATonomous?

DevOps is important because it allows for unification of WATonomous' code base. Without it, it is very hard to integrate each sub team's code base with each other. However, with a DevOp's team, this process of building and testing each sub team's code can be regulated. This way, any code that doesn't meet spec will not be pushed. The code that does get pushed means that it has been vetted and check to ensure that it will be compatible with the rest of the code base.
